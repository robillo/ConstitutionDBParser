While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article 31.<br><br>The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up.<br><br>The main objects of this Bill are, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise.<br><br>It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice.<br><br>In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified.<br><br>Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill.

Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies and the number of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population.<br><br>The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however, requires that upon the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re-adjusted by such authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine. A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament. Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effecting re-adjustment of the representation in the House of the People and in the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951.There is a considerable difference between the population of the several States as estimated in the President\\'s order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951.<br><br>At present, seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500 members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total number of seats allotted to these States. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, therefore, that article 81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re-adjustment of representation in the House of the People as required under article 81(3) of the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively.<br><br>NEW DELHI; C.C.

			"content": "<b>The Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955</b><br><br>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1954 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1954<br><br>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS<br><br>This Bill seeks to amend articles 31, 31A and 305 of, and the Ninth Schedule to, the Constitution.<br><br>2. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same subject. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State\\'s power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill.<br><br>3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following:-<br><br>(i) While the abolition of zamindari system and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings.<br><br>(ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas.<br><br>(iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State.<br><br>(iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution.<br><br>(v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge.<br><br>It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categories of essential welfare legislation.<br><br>4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is proposed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B.<br><br>5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It appears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clear authority of Parliament or of a State Legislature to introduce State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law might have to be justified before the courts as being \"in the public interest\" under article 301 or as amounting to a \"reasonable restriction\" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such question ought to be left to the final decision of the Legislatue. Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly proposes an amendment of article 305 to make this clear.<br><br>NEW DELHI; JAWAHARLAL NEHRU.<br><br>The 17th December, 1954.<br><br>THE CONSTITUTION (FOURTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1955[27th April, 1955.]<br><br>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.<br><br>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Sixth Year of the Republic of India as follow:-<br><br>1.

Substitution of new article for article 305.-For article 305 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted, namely:-<br><br>\"305. Saving of existing laws and laws providing for State monopolies.-Nothing in articles 301 and 303 shall affect the provisions of any existing law except in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct; and nothing in article 301 shall affect the operation of any law made before the commencement of the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, in so far as it relates to, or prevent Parliament or the Legislature of a State from making any law relating to, any such matter as is referred to in sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) of article 19.\".<br><br>5.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution Ninth Amendment) Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 29 of 1956) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>In order to implement the scheme of States reorganisation, it is necessary to make numerous amendments in the Constitution with effect from the 1st October, 1956. This bill seeks to make these amendments and also some other amendments to certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the High Courts and High Court Judges, the executive power of the Union and the States, and a few entries in the legislative lists. The reasons for making the amendments are indicated below:-</p><br> <p>Clause 2.-The reorganisation scheme involves not only the establishment of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of the existing States, but also the abolition of the three categories of States (Part A, Part B and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as Union territories. Article 1 has to be suitably amended for this purpose and the First Schedule completely revised.</p><br> <p>Clause 3.-The amendments proposed in article 80 are formal and consequential. The territorial changes and the formation of new states and Union territories as proposed in Part II of the States Reorganisation Bill, 1956, involve a complete revision of the Fourth Schdule to the Constitution by which the seats in the Council of States are allocated to the existing States. The present allocation is made on the basis of the population of each State as ascertained at the census of 1941 and the number of seats allotted to each Part A and Part B State is according to the formula, one seat per million for the first five millions and one seat for every additional two millions or part thereof exceeding one million. It is proposed to revise the allocation of seats on the basis of the latest census figures, but according to the same formula as before.</p><br> <p>Clause 4.-The abolition of Part C States as such and the establishment of Union territories make extensive amendment of articles 81 and 82 inevitable. The provision in article 81(1)(b) that \"the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies\" will no longer be appropriate, since after reorganisation each of the States will be large enough to be divided into a number of constituencies and will not permit of being grouped together with other States for this purpose or being \"formed\" into a single territorial constituency. Clause (2) of article 81 and article 82 will require to be combined and revised in order to make suitable provision for Union territories. Instead of amending the articles piecemeal, it is proposed to revise and simplify them. Incidentally, it is proposed in clause (1)(b) of the revised article 81 to fix a maximum for the total number of representatives that may be assigned to the Union territories by Parliament.</p><br> <p>Clause 5.-The proposed revision of the proviso to article 131 is consequential on the disappearance of Part B States as such. The two parts of the existing proviso have been combined.</p><br> <p>Clause 6.-Article 153 provides that there shall be a Governor for each State. Since it may be desirable in certain circumstances to appoint a Governor for two or more States, it is proposed to add a proviso to this article to remove any possible technical bar to such an appointment.</p><br> <p>Clause 7.-Sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of article 168 provides for bi-cameral legislatures in certain States. It is proposed that, among the reorganised States, Punjab and Mysore should continue to have such a legislature, and that the enlarged Madhya Pradesh should also be provided with one. Since the constitution of a Legislative Council for Madhya Pradesh will necessarily take time, it is proposed to bring the relevant amendment of article 168(1)(a) into force from a future date by means of a public notification of the President.</p><br> <p>Clause 8.-This seeks to revise article 170 mainly with a view to bringing it into line with articles 81 and 82 as revised by clause 4.</p><br> <p>Clause 9.-Under clause (1) of article 171, the maximum strength of the Legislative Council of a State is fixed at one-fourth of the strength of the Legislative Assembly of that State. Although in the larger States, like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, this maximum is adequate, it leads to difficulties in the case of the smaller States. It is, therefore, proposed to alter the maximum to one-third of the strength of the Legislative Assembly.</p><br> <p>Clause 10.-Article 216 empowers the President to appoint to a High Court as many judges as he may from time to time deem it necessary and also to fix the maximum number of judges for each High Court by a separate order. The proviso is of little significance from the practical point of view, since the order fixing the maximum may be changed by the President whenever necessary. The appointment of additional and acting judges for which provision is sought to be made in clause 14 will also involve either frequent modifications in the order or a fixation of the maximum number at a high figure. It is, therefore, proposed to omit the proviso to article 216.</p><br> <p>Clause 11.-The amendment of clause (1) of article 217 proposed in this clause is consequential on the proposal to provide for the appointment of additional and acting judges for limited periods.</p><br> <p>Clause 12.-An important factor affecting the selection of High Court judges from the bar is the total prohibition contained in article 220 on practice after their retirement from the bench. It is proposed to revise the article so as to relax this complete ban and permit a retired judge to practise in the Supreme Court and in any High Court other than the one in the which he was a permanent judge.</p><br> <p>Clause 13.-Article 222 empowers the President to transfer judges from one High Court to another. Clause (2) of this article goes on to provide that when a judge is so transferred he shall be entitled to receive in addition to his salary a compensatory allowance. It is felt that there is no real justification for granting such an allowance and it is accordingly proposed to omit clause (2).</p><br> <p>Clause 14.-The provision in article 224 for recalling retired judges to function on the bench of a High Court for short periods has been found to be neither adequate nor satisfactory. It is, therefore, proposed to replace this article by a provision for the appointment of additional judges to clear off arrears and for the appointment of acting judges in temporary vacancies.</p><br> <p>Clause 15.-It is proposed to revise and simplify articles 230, 231 and 232 having regard to the constitutional position of States and Union territories after reorganisation. While under article 214 there will normally be a separate High Court for each State, power will be required to establish common High Courts for two or more States. Power will also be required to extend the jurisdiction of a High Court to a Union territory, wherever necessary, and to exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court from such territory. The revised articles 230 and 231 are designed to make these provisions.</p><br> <p>Clause 16.-Part VIII of the Constitution provides for the administration of Part C States and Part IX for the administration of Part D territories. It is proposed to amend Part VIII to provide for the administration of Union territories and to repeal Part IX.</p><br> <p>Clause 17.-While the President is empowered by article 258 (1) to entrust Union functions to a State Government or its officers, there is no corresponding provision enabling the Governor of a State to entrust State functions to the Central Government or its officers. This lacuna has been found to be of practical consequence in connection with the execution of certain development projects in the States. It is proposed to fill the lacuna by a new article 258A.</p><br> <p>Clause 18.-Article VIII of the Covenant entered into by the Rulers of Travancore and Cochin in May, 1949, for the formation of the United State of Travancore and Cochin provided that Travancore\'s obligation to contribute annually a sum of Rs. 51 lakhs to the Travancore Devaswom Fund should continue as an obligation of the United State. This arrangement was confirmed by article 238(10) (ii) of the Constitution. It is proposed that the existing arrangement should be continued even after the formation of the new State of Kerala , but the contribution to the Travancore Devaswom Board from the Consolidated Fund of that State should, in view of the transfer of territory from Travancore-Cochin to Madras, be reduced from Rs. 51 lakhs to Rs. 46.5 lakhs.</p><br> <p>Clause 19.-In this clause it is proposed to revise and amplify the scope of article 298, mainly to make it clear that Union Government, as well as the State Governments, are competent to carry on any commercial or industrial undertaking, whether or not it is related to a matter within the legislative competence of the Union, or, as the case may be, of the State. Similarly , the holding, acquisition and disposal of property and the making of contracts by the Union or a State could be for any purpose without constitutional impropriety. At the same time, the revised article provides that this extended executive power of the Union and of the States will be subject, in the former case, to legislation by the State, and in the latter case, to legislation by Parliament.</p><br> <p>Clause 20.-The new article 350A proposed in this clause is designed to implement one of the States Reorganisation Commission\'s important recommendations regarding safeguards for linguistic minorities in the States after reorganisation.</p><br> <p>Clause 21.-It is proposed to replace article 371 by another article making a special provision with respect to the States of Andhra and Punjab. This article will enable the President to constitute regional committees of the State Legislative Assembly and secure their proper functioning by directing suitable modifications to be made in the rules of business of Government and in the rules of procedure of the Assembly.</p><br> <p>Clause 22.-The High Court of Travancore-Cochin will, as from the appointed day, become the High Court for the new State of Kerala and the High Courts of Mysore and Rajasthan will continue, respectively, as the High Courts for the enlarged \"new\" States with the same names. Taking into account the level of income at the bar and salaries payable to the judicial services in these States, it is considered that there is no need to increase the salaries payable to the Judges of these High Courts to the level of the other High Courts. It is proposed to amend sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 10 of the Second Schedule to the Constitution providing for a salary of Rs. 3,000 to the Chief Justices, and Rs. 2,500 to the other Judges, of these three High Courts. Sometimes it becomes necessary to appoint a retired district judge as a judge of a High Court . In the absence of a legal provision for withholding the pension due to such a judge, it has been the practise to obtain from him an undertaking that he would not claim the pension for the period for which he serves as a High Court judge. Since this is obviously unsatisfactory, it is proposed to add a proviso to paragraph 10(1) of the Second Schedule on the same lines as the proviso to paragraph 9(1) thereof regulating the salary of a judge of the Supreme Court in similar circumstances.</p><br> <p>Sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph 10 are no longer required, since appropriate provision has been made in the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Ace, 1954.</p><br> <p>Clause 23.-The existence of three entries in the legislative lists (33 of List I, 36 of List II and 42 of List III) relating to the essentially single subject of acquisition and requisitioning of property by the Government gives rise to unnecessary technical difficulties in legislation. In order to avoid these difficulties and simplify the constitutional position, it is proposed to omit the entries in the Union and State List and replace the entry in the Concurrent List by a comprehensive entry covering the whole subject.</p><br> <p>Clause 24.-Entry 67 of the Union List refers to \"ancient and historical monuments and records, and archaeological sites and remains ,declared by Parliament by law to be of national importance\". A large number of ancient monuments, archaeological sites, etc., have been declared to be of national importance by an Act of Parliament. It requires another Act of Parliament to make the slightest alteration in, or addition to, the lists in that Act, which seems to be and unduly cumbrous procedure.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1954 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1954</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>This Bill seeks to amend articles 31, 31A and 305 of, and the Ninth Schedule to, the Constitution.</p><br> <p>2. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same object. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State\'s power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill.</p><br> <p>3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following:-</p><br> <p>(i) While the abolition of zamindari system and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings.</p><br> <p>(ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas.</p><br> <p>(iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State.</p><br> <p>(iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution.</p><br> <p>(v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge.</p><br> <p>It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categories of essential welfare legislation.</p><br> <p>4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is proposed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B.</p><br> <p>5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It appears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clear authority of Parliament or of a State Legislature to introduce State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law might have to be justified before the courts as being \"in the public interest\" under article 301 or as amounting to a \"reasonable restriction\" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such question ought to the final decision of the Legislatue. Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly proposes an amendment of article 305 to make this clear.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; JAWAHARLAL NEHRU.</p><br> <p>The 17th December, 1954.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (EIGHTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1959</p><br> <p>[5th January,1960.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Tenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:---</p><br> <p>1. Short title.-This Act may be called the Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1959.</p><br> <p>2.

West Pakistan-Punjab border.-Of the total of 325 miles of the border in this sector, demarcation has been completed along about 252 miles. About 73 miles of the border has not yet been demarcated due to differences between the Governments of India and Pakistan regarding interpretation of the decision and Award of the Punjab Boundary Commission presented by Sir Cyril Radcliffe as Chairman of the Commission. These differences have been settled along the lines given below in a spirit of accommodation:</p><br> <p>(i) The Sarja Marja, Rakh Hardit Singh and Pathanke (Amritsar- Lahore border).-The Governments of India and Pakistan agree that the boundary between West-Pakistan and India in the this region should follow the boundary between the Tehsils of Lahore and Kasur as laid down under Punjab Government Notification No. 2183-E, dated 2nd June, 1939. These three villages will in consequence, fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan.</p><br> <p>(iv) Suleimanke (Ferozepur-Montgomery border).-The Governments of India and Pakistan agree to adjust the district boundaries in this region as specified in the attached Schedule and as shown in the map appended thereto as Annexure I.</p><br> <p>(Sd.)

It is further proposed to amend clause (1) of article 240 of the Constitution to include therein the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in order to enable the President to make regulations for the peace, progress and good government of the territory.</p><br> <p>The Bill seeks to give effect to these proposals.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI. JAWAHARLAL NEHRU.</p><br> <p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 35 of 1956) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>While \"taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers\" is an entry in the State List, article 286 of the Constitution subjects the States\\' power to impose such taxes to four restrictions, of which two are total and two are partial. Under clause (1) of the article, a State is debarred from imposing such a tax when the sale or purchase takes place outside the State or in the course of import into, or export from, the country. With regard to the first restriction, namely, the non-taxability of sales outside the State, an explanation is given in the clause that \"a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State\". Then, under clause (2), a State is debarred from imposing the tax on inter-State sales except in so far as Parliament may otherwise provide. Lastly, under clause (3), Parliament is authorised to declare the goods which are essential to the life of the community, and when such a declaration has been made, any law made by a State legislature imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of those goods has to receive the President\\'s assent in order to be effective.</p><br> <p>High judicial authorities have found the interpretation of the article a difficult task and expressed divergent views as to the scope and effect, in particular, of the explanation in clause (1) and of clause (2). The majority view of the Supreme Court in the State of Bombay v. the United Motors (India) Ltd., (1953) S.C.R. 1069, was that sub-clause (a) and the explanation in clause (1) prohibited the taxation of a sale involving inter-State elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein, and further more, that clause (2) did not affect the power of that State to tax the inter-State sale even though Parliament had not made a law removing the ban imposed by that clause. This resulted in dealers resident in one State being subjected to the sales tax jurisdiction and procedure of several other States with which they had dealings in the normal course of their business. Two-and-a-half years later, the second part of his decision was reversed by the supreme Court in the Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. the State of Bihar. (1955) S.C.A. 1140 but here too the Court was not unanimous.</p><br> <p>In pursuance of clause (3) of the article, Parliament passed an Act in 1952 declaring a number of goods like foodstuffs of various kinds, cloth, raw cotton, cattle feeds, iron and steel, coal, etc., to be essential to the life of the community. Since this declaration could not affect pre-existing State laws imposing sales tax on these goods, the result was a wide disparity from State to States, not only in the range of exempted goods, but also in the rates applicable to them.</p><br> <p>The Taxation Enquiry Commission, after examining the problem with great care and throughness, have made certain recommendations which may be summarised as follows. In essence, sales tax must continue to be a State source of revenue and its levy and administration must substantially pertain to the State Governments. The sphere of power and responsibility of the State may, however, be said to end, and that of the Union to begin, when the sales tax of one State impinges, administratively on the dealers, and fiscally on the consumers, of another State. Broadly, therefore, inter-State sales should be the concern of the Union, but the responsibilities pertaining to the Union could be exercised through the State Governments, and in any case, the revenue should appropriately devolve on them. Intra-State sales, on the other hand, should be left to the States, but with one important exception. Where, for instance, raw material produced in a State is important from the point of view of the consumer or the industry of another State, certain restrictions have to be placed on the taxing power of the State Government, as otherwise it can effect an increase in the st of the manufactured article, whether such manufacture takes place in the State which produces the raw material, or in another State which imports the material from that State. In either case, to the extent that the finished goods are consumed in a State other than the one which taxes the raw material, the increase in cost on account of the tax is a matter of direct concern to the consumer of another State. Such cases of intra-State sales should appropriately be brought under the full control of the Union. These recommendations of the Commission have been generally accepted by all the State Governments.</p><br> <p>The object of this Bill is to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission as regards the amendment of the constitutional provisions relating to sales tax.</p><br> <p>In clause 2, it is proposed to add a new entry 92A in the Union List placing taxes on inter-State sales and purchases within the exclusive legislative and executive power of the Union, and to make entry 54 of the State List \"subject to the provisions\" of this new entry.</p><br> <p>In clause 3, it is proposed to add these taxes to the list given in clause (1) of article 269, so that, although they will be levied and collected in accordance with an Act of Parliament, they will not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India, but will accrue to the States themselves in accordance with such principles of distribution as may be formulated by Parliament by law. A further provision is proposed in article 269 expressly empowering Parliament to formulate by law principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.</p><br> <p>It is proposed in clause 4 to omit from clause (1) of article 286 the explanation which has given rise to a great deal of legal controversy and practical difficulty. In view of the centralisation of inter-State sales tax proposed in clause 2 of this Bill clause (2) of article 286 in its present form will cease to be appropriate. In its place it is proposed to insert a provision empowering Parliament to formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place (a) outside a State, or (b) in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India or (c) in the course of export of the goods out of the territory of India.</p><br> <p>It is further proposed to replace clause (3) of article 286 by a new clause on the lines recommended by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. Under this revised clause Parliament will have the power to declare by law the goods which are of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) will be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the sale or purchase of those goods.</p><br> <p>[BW DELHI; MANILAL SHAH.</p><br> <p>The 30th April, 1956.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (TENTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1961</p><br> <p>[16th August, 1961.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twelfth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

The requirement that members of the two Houses should assemble at a joint sitting for the election of the Vice-President seems to be totally unnecessary and may also cause practical difficulties. It is, therefore, proposed to amend this article to provide that the Vice-President will be elected by members of an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament. Under article 54 of the Constitution, the President is elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the Legislative Assemblies of the States. Every effort is made to complete such elections before the date of the Presidential election. It is, however, possible that the elections to the two Houses of Parliament may not be completed before the President or the Vice-President is elected.

The Bill also provides for representation of the territory in the Council of States.</p><br> <p>It is proposed to create Legislatures and Councils of Ministers in the Union territories of Himanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry broadly on the pattern of the scheme which was in force in some of the Part C States before the reorganisation of the States. The Bill seeks to confer necessary legislative power on Parliament to enact laws for this purpose through a new article 239A which follows generally the provisions of article 240 as it stood before the reorganisation of the States.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; LAL BAHADUR.</p><br> <p>The 25th August, 1962.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1962</p><br> <p>[28th December, 1962.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Bill, 1962 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>Several amendments to the Constitution have been under consideration for a long time. The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in November, 1955, to give effect to some of them. For various reasons, the Bill could not be proceeded with, and it was allowed to lapse except the one relating to the amendment of article 3 of the Constitution. This article was amended separately by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1955. The present Bill contains some of the proposals included in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill and, in addition, there are a few more proposals for amendment of the Constitution. The proposals relating to articles 276, 297, 311, and 316 of the Constitution were contained in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill and they have been adopted with some minor modifications. The new proposals relate to articles 124, 128, 217, 220, 222, 224A, 226 and entry 78 of the Union List.</p><br> <p>2. It is proposed to amend article 217 so as to raise the age of retirement of High Court Judges from sixty years to sixty-two years. When any question arises to the correct age of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court, the question has to be decided by the President. It is proposed to make the position clear by making a specific provision in articles 124 and 217. It is considered desirable in the public interest that Judges should be transferred from one High Court to another. Such transfer is expected to impose additional financial burden on the Judge who is so transferred. It is, therefore, proposed to pay him some compensatory allowance in addition to his salary. When a Judge is transferred from one High Court to another, he cannot, in view of the provisions of article 220, resume practice in any of the High Courts in which he has held office as a Judge. The provisions of article 220 therefore put a check on the proposal for the transfer of any Judge of a High Court. It is, therefore, propose d to amend article 220 so that the restriction regarding resumption of practice should apply only to the High Court from which the Judge retires, provided that he had served in that High Court for a period of at least five years immediately before retirement. Such a provision would facilitate the transfer of Judges. Under the existing article 226 of the Constitution, the only High Court which has jurisdiction with respect to the Central Government is the Punjab High Court. This involves considerable hardship to litigants from distant places. It is, therefore, proposed to amend article 226 so that when any relief is sought against any Government, authority or person for any action taken, the High Court within whose jurisdiction the cause of action arise may also have jurisdiction to issue appropriate directions, orders or writs. The other new proposals are of a minor character.</p><br> <p>3. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the provisions thereof.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; A. K.

The protection of this article is available only in respect of such tenures as were estates on the 26th January, 1950, when the Constitution came into force. The expression \"estate\" has been defined differently in different States and, as a result of the transfer of land from one State to another on account of the reorganisation of States, the expression has come to be defined differently in different parts of the same State. Moreover, many of the land reform enactments relate to lands which are not included in an estate. Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on the ground that the provisions of those Acts were violative of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the protection of article 31A was not available to them. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the definition of \"estate\" in article 31A of the Constitution by including therein, lands held under ryotwari settlement and also other lands in respect of which provisions are normally made in land reform enactments. It is further proposed to provide that where any law makes a provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof.</p><br> <p>2.

In another judgment, the Supreme Court had held that the power of posting of a district judge under article 233 does not include the power of transfer of such judge from one station to another and that the power of transfer of a district judge is vested in the High Court under article 235 of the Constitution. As a result of these judgments, a serious situation has arisen because doubt has been thrown on the validity of the judgments, decrees, orders and sentences passed or made by these district judges and a number of writ petitions and other cases have already been filed challenging their validity. The functioning of the district courts in Uttar Pradesh has practically come to a standstill.

In the Bank Nationalization case [1970, 3 S.C.R. 530), the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution guarantees right to compensation, that is, the equivalent in money of the property compulsorily acquired. Thus in effect the adequacy of compensation and the relevancy of the principles laid down by the Legislature for determining the amount of compensation have virtuality become justiciable inasmuch as the Court can go into the question whether the amount paid to the owner of the property is what may be regarded reasonably as compensation for loss of property. In the same case, the Court has also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for a public purpose should also satisfy the requirements of article 19 (1) (f).</p><br> <p>The Bill seeks to surmount the difficulties placed in the way of giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the aforesaid interpretation.

The Bill further seeks to introduce a new article 31C which provides that if any law is passed to give effect to the Directive Principles contained in clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and contains a declaration to that effect, such law shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abridges any of the rights contained in article 14, 19 or 31 and shall not be questioned on the ground that it does not give effect to those principles. For this provision to apply in the case of laws made by State Legislatures, it is necessary that the relevant Bill should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; H.

It is necessary for this purpose, apart from amending the relevant provisions of the Constitution, to insert a new article therein so as to terminate expressly the recognition already granted to such Rulers and to abolish privy purses and extinguish all rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of privy purses.

It is proposed to achieve this object by including the Union territory of Mizoram in article 239A of THE CONSTITUTION (clause 2).</p><br> <p>The Study Team appointed by the Administrative Reforms Commission on the Administration of Union Territories and NEFA has recommended that the Administrator of a Union territory with legislature may have the power to promulgate ordinances when the legislature is not in session. It is proposed to accept this recommendation and include a suitable provision in the Constitution conferring on such an Administrator the power to promulgate Ordinances (clause 3).</p><br> <p>Under paragraph 18(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution read with article 240 of the Constitution, the President is empowered to make Regulations for the North-East Frontier Agency. It is proposed to continue these powers even after the Agency becomes the Union territory of Arunachal Pradesh under the reorganisation scheme. It is also proposed to have similar powers with respect to the Union territory of Mizoram (clause 4).</p><br> <p>When the legislature of a State is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by a proclamation under article 356 of the Constitution, the Parliament is empowered to confer legislative powers on the President in respect of that State by passing a law under article 357(1). No such provision exists in the case of Union territories with legislatures, with the result that whenever the legislature of any Union territory is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by an order of the President, all legislation relating to that Union territory has to be passed by the Parliament. It is proposed that in such circumstances the Regulation making power under article 240 should be available to the President (clause 4).</p><br> <p>Hill Areas of Manipur are Predominantly inhabited by members of Scheduled Tribes. To safeguard their interests special provisions were made in section 562 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 for a Committee of the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Manipur consisting of members from the Hill Areas. When the Union territory of Manipur becomes a State under the reorganisation scheme, the said section 52 will cease to be operative. It is proposed, as a part of the scheme of safeguards for the people of the Hill Areas, to continue this arrangement even after Manipur becomes a State. So, a specific provision is being made in the Constitution for the formation of such a Committee (clause 5).</p><br> <p>This Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; K.

In the course of implementation, the State Government faced serious practical difficulties and to overcome them, that Act was extensively amended by the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Act 35 of 1969) and by the Kerala and Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Act 25 of 1971). Certain crucial provisions of the principal Act as amended were challenged in the High Court of Kerala and in the Supreme Court, creating a climate of uncertainty in the effective implementation of land reforms. Although the High Court of Kerala has generally upheld the scheme of land reforms envisaged in the principal Act as amended, a few vital provisions have been struck down by the High Court. Even in regard to the provisions upheld by the High Court, the affected parties had moved the Supreme Court in appeal. Some persons also moved the Supreme Court in original petitions challenging certain provisions of the Act. The Supreme Court in its judgments delivered on 26th and 28th April, 1972, have generally uphold the scheme of land reforms as envisaged in the principal Act as amended but agreed with the High Court invalidating certain crucial provisions. It is feared that this will have far-reaching adverse affects on the implementation of the programme of land reforms in the State and thousands of tenants will be adversely affected by some of the provisions which have been either struck down or rendered ineffective. It is also apprehended that certain observations of the Supreme Court in the judgments might open the flood-gates of litigation much to the detriment of thousands of Kudikidappukars in the State who will not be able to defend themselves in protracted legal proceedings. Further, appeals have been preferred against the judgment of the Kerala High Court invalidating certain important provisions of the principal Act as amended [e.g. sections 4A (1)(a) and (b), 7, 7D(1) and 103] and they are pending in the Supreme Court.</p><br> <p>2. It is, therefore, proposed to include the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution so that they may have the protection under article 31B and any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to the validity of those Acts is removed.

At present an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, inter alia, on a certificate given by a High Court that the amount or the value of the subject-matter of dispute is not less than twenty thousand rupees or that the judgment, decree or final order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or question respecting property of the like amount. The valuation cannot be the rational yardstick for a right to appeal. An important question of law can arise even in suits of small value and the test of valuation results in cases without merit going up to the Supreme Court. The Law Commission recommended that clauses (a) and (b) of article 133(1) of the Constitution should be omitted and that an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court only if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance and that in the opinion of the High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.

As a result of the enactment of the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971 (81 of 1971), the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha allotted to the States has increased to 506, six more than the permissible limit of 500 under article 81. The actual total number of elected members of the present Lok Sabha is 522 (489 from the fifteen major States, 17 from the six smaller States of Himanchal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura each of which has a population of less than six millions and 16 from the nine Union territories).</p><br> <p>2. Clause (2) of article 81 of the Constitution lays down that for the purposes of sub-clause (a) of clause (1), there shall be allotted to each State a number of seats in the House of the People in such manner that the ratio between that number and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for all States and that each State shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is, so far as practicable, the same throughout the State. Under clause (3) of article 81, the expression \"population\" means the population as ascertained in the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published. Article 82 enjoins that on the completion of each census, the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the State and the division of each State into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may by law determine. In pursuance of article 82, Parliament had enacted the Delimitation Act, 1972 and the Delimitation Commission has been constituted to undertake the necessary task of the readjustment envisaged in article 82.It will be noticed that adherence to the principles laid down in clause (2) of article 81 by the Delimitation Commission in undertaking readjustment as enjoined by article 82 on the basis of the 1971-census figures may have the effect of affecting the number of seats allotted to the States in the House of the People. It is felt that it would be better to ensure that any readjustment and consequent allocation of seats does not adversely affect the existing number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and to achieve this purpose it would be necessary to increase the strength of the Lok Sabha suitably.</p><br> <p>3. In order to ensure that there is no reduction in the existing representation in the House of the People in respect of any of the States, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend article 81 so as to increase the upper limit for representation of the States from 500 to 525. The opportunity is taken to decrease the limit for the Union territories from 25 to 20, as the existing representation for Union territories is only 16. Government also consider it necessary to make an amendment in clause (2) of article 81 to provide that the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of article 81 shall not be applicable to any State so long as its population does not exceed six millions. This is to ensure that the existing representation in the Lok Sabha is maintained for the smaller States referred to in paragraph 1 above.</p><br> <p>4. Article 330 of the Constitution relates to reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The provisons of this article have, however, been made inapplicable to the State of Nagaland on the ground that it has a predominantly tribal population. According to the 1971-census, 88.6 per cent. of Nagaland\\'s population belong to the Scheduled Tribes. The corresponding figures for the State of Meghalaya and the Union territories of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram are 80.5 per cent., 79.0 per cent. and 94.3 per cent. respectively. Government, therefore, consider that the provisions of article 330 should not apply also to the predominantly tribal units of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Similarly, it is considered that as in the case of Nagaland, there need be no reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Meghalaya and the article 332 of the Constitution may be amended suitably. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to achieve these objects.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; H. R.

The provisions of clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution were intended to give effect to certain features of these safeguards. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, was enacted inter alia to provide for employment opportunities for residents of Telangana area. But in 1969, the Supreme Court held the relevant provision of the Act to be unconstitutional is so far as it related to the safeguards envisaged for the Telangana area. Owing to a variety of causes, the working of the safeguards gave rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction sometimes in the Telangana area and sometimes in the other areas of the State. Measures were devised from time to time to resolve the problems. Recently several leaders of Andhra Pradesh made a concerted effort to analyse the factors which have been giving rise to the dissatisfaction and find enduring answers to the problems with a view to achieving fuller emotional integration of the people of Andhra Pradesh. On the 21st September, 1973, they suggested certain measures (generally known as the Six-Point Formula) indicating a uniform approach for promoting accelerated development of the backward areas of the State so as to secure the balanced development of the State as a whole and for providing equitable opportunities to different areas of the State in this matter of education, employment and career prospects in public services. This formula has received wide support in Andhra Pradesh and has been endorsed by the State Government.</p><br> <p>2. This Bill has been brought forward to provide the necessary constitutional authority for giving effect to the Six-Point Formula in so far as it relates to the provision of equitable opportunities for people of different areas of the State in the matter of admission to educational institutions and public employment and constitution of an Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction to deal with certain disputes and grievances relating to public services. The Bill also seeks to empower Parliament to legislate for establishing a Central University in the State and contains provisions of an incidental and consequential nature including the provision for the validation of certain appointments made in the past. As the Six-Point Formula provides for the discontinuance of the Regional Committee constituted under clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution, the Bill also provides for the repeal of that clause.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; UMA SHANKAR DIKSHIT.</p><br> <p>The 12th December, 1973.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (THIRTY-SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1973</p><br> <p>[3rd May, 1974.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

The Resolution declared that the Assembly had satisfied itself that these activities of the Chogyal not only violated the objectives of the Agreement of May 8, 1973, but also ran counter to the wishes of the people of Sikkim and impeded their democratic development and participation in the political and economic life of India. Accordingly the Assembly solemnly declared and resolved that \"The institution of the Chogyal is hereby abolished and Sikkim shall henceforth be a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible Government\".</p><br> <p>2. The Assembly also resolved that this Resolution be submitted to the people of Sikkim forthwith for their approval. A special opinion poll conducted by the Government of Sikkim on the 14th April, 1975 resulted in a total of 59,637 votes in favour and 1,496 votes against the Resolution out of a total electorate of approximately 97,000.</p><br> <p>3. The result of this poll was communicated to the Government of India by the Chief Minister of Sikkim on the 15th April, 1975. The Chief Minister on behalf of the Council of Ministers strongly requested the Government of India to make an immediate response and accept the above decision, taking, as has been requested in the Assembly Resolution of the 10th April, 1975, such measures as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the decision as early as possible.</p><br> <p>4. The Chief Minister and other Ministers of Sikkim also visited New Delhi on the 16th-17th April, 1975 and urged the Government of India to take immediate action in this behalf.</p><br> <p>5. Accordingly, it is proposed to include Sikkim as a full-fledged State in the First Schedule to the Constitution and to allot to Sikkim one seat in the Council of States and one seat in the House of the People. It is also proposed to insert a new article containing the provisions considered necessary to meet the special circumstances and needs of Sikkim.</p><br> <p>6.

It has a Pradesh Council, consisting mostly of representatives of Zila Parishads, which functions as an advisory body on important matters relating to the administration of the Union territory. Some members of the Pradesh Council are also associated with the Chief Commissioner in the day-to-day administration as Counsellors. It is proposed to replace the Pradesh Council by a Legislative Assembly and the Counsellors by a Council of Ministers, as in certain other Union territories specified in article 239A of the Constitution. The Bill, therefore, seeks to include Arunachal Pradesh in that article.</p><br> <p>2. Under article 240 of the Constitution, the President is empowered to make regulations for the Union territory of Arunchal Pradesh. With the Constitution of a Legislative Assembly for the Union territory, it is proposed to provide that, as in the case of other Union territories with Legislatures, this power may be exercised only when the Assembly is either dissolved or its functioning remains suspended.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Bill, 1975 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1975</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>The Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Bill, 1975 seeks to amend articles 123, 213, 239B, 352, 356, 359 and 360 of the Constitution.</p><br> <p>2. Article 123 empowers the President to promulgate Ordinances when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session if he is satisfied that circumstance exist rendering it necessary to take immediate action. Corresponding powers have been conferred by the Constitution on the Governor under article 213. Similar powers have been conferred on the Administrator under article 239B when the Legislature of a Union territory is not in session. On the plain language of articles 123, 213 and 239B there is no doubt that the satisfaction mentioned in those articles is subjective satisfaction and that it is not justiciable. There is no doubt that this was also the intention of the makers of the Constitution. However, litigation is pending involving the justifiability of this issue and contentions are being raised that the issue is subject to judicial scrutiny. To place the matter beyond doubt, it is proposed to provide in the Constitution that the satisfaction of the President, Governor or Administrator shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.</p><br> <p>3. Article 352 empowers the President to declare Emergency if he is satisfied that the security of India or any part of it is threatened by war, external aggression or internal disturbance. Article 356 empowers the President to assume to himself the functions of the Government of a State if the constitutional machinery in any State fails and the Government in the State cannot be carried on. Likewise article 360 empowers the President to declare Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that the financial stability of India is threatened. Here again, the issue regarding satisfaction is, on the face of the articles clearly not justiciable. However, as the validity of the Proclamation issued under article 352 has been challenged in several proceedings and as litigation of this nature involves waste of public time and money, it is proposed to amend these three articles so as to make the satisfaction of the President final and conclusive and not justiciable on any ground.</p><br> <p>4. In addition to article 352, contentions have been raised in certain writ petitions that while the original Proclamation of Emergency is in operation no further Proclamation of Emergency could be made thereunder. In order to place the matter beyond doubt it is proposed to make it clear in article 352 that the President may issue different Proclamations on different grounds whether or not there is a Proclamation already in existence and in operation.</p><br> <p>5. When a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President is empowered under article 359 of the Constitution to make an order suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in that order. It was intended that the powers conferred by this article should be exercised during an emergency according to needs of the situation. On the other hand, article 358 renders the provisions of article 19 automatically inoperative while the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, and the power to make any law or to take any executive action is not restricted by the provisions of that article. The intention underlying article 359 appears to be that when an order is made under clause (1) of that article in relation to any of the rights conferred by Part III and mentioned in the order, the order so made would have for all practical purposes the same effect in relation to those rights as article 358 has in relation to article 19. It is, therefore, proposed not to have any differences in language between article 358 and the language in respect of those rights only which may be mentioned in the Presidential Order under clause (1) of article 359.</p><br> <p>6. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE.</p><br> <p>The 20th July, 1975.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (THIRTY-EIGHTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1975</p><br> <p>[1st August, 1975.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

The same article provides that matters relating to their election shall be regulated by a parliamentary law. So far as the Prime Minister and the Speaker are concerned, matters relating to their election are regulated by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Under this Act the High Court has jurisdiction to try an election petition presented against either of them.</p><br> <p>2. The President, the Vice-President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are holders of high offices. The President is not answerable to a court of law for anything done, while in office, in the exercise of his powers. A fortiori matters relating to his election should not be brought before a court of law but should be entrusted to a forum other than a court. The same reasoning applies equally to the incumbents of the offices of Vice-President, Prime Minister and Speaker. It is accordingly proposed to provide that disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice-President shall be determined by a forum as may be determined by a parliamentary law. Similar provision is proposed to be made in the case of the election to either House of Parliament or, as the case may be, to the House of the People of a person holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker. It is further proposed to render pending proceedings in respect of such election under the existing law null and void. The Bill also provides that the parliamentary law creating a new forum for trial of election matters relating to the incumbents of the high offices abovementioned shall not be called in question in any court.</p><br> <p>3. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interests of the public was imperilled by litigation. It has become necessary to have recourse to this device once again now. Between 1971 and 1973 legislation was enacted for nationalising coking coal and coal mines for conservating these resources in the interests of steel industry. These enactments have been brought before courts on the ground that they are unconstitutional. So is the case of sick textile undertakings which were nationalised in 1974. To prevent smuggling of goods and diversion of foreign exchange which affected national economy Parliament enacted legislation which again has been challenged in the Supreme Court and in High Courts. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necessary should have the constitutional protection under article 31B, are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain State legislations relating to land reform and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B.</p><br> <p>4. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; H. R.

India has sovereign rights over the resources of the exclusive economic zone and is entitled to exercise jurisdiction in respect of certain other matters. It is proposed to amend article 297 of the Constitution so as to provide that all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the exclusive economic zone of India and all other resources of the exclusive economic zone of India shall also vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union. At present, the limits of territorial waters and the continental shelf are determined by Proclamation issued by the President. It is proposed that the limits of the territorial waters, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone and the maritime zones of India shall be as specified from time to time by or under law made by Parliament.</p><br> <p>2. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation. Certain State legislations relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B inasmuch as in many cases such enactments have been challenged in courts and courts have granted interim reliefs which has hampered the implementation of the national land reform policy.</p><br> <p>3. Besides these Acts relating to land reforms certain State enactments relating to private forests require protection of article 31B as these enactments are progressive and beneficial pieces of legislation intended to and the monopoly of vested interests and forest contractors. Some of such legislations have been challenged in courts and as the courts have granted interim reliefs staying the operation of these enactments, the State Governments have not been able to implement these legislations.</p><br> <p>4. Certain Central laws like the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and certain provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 require protection of article 31B. If these legislations are allowed to be challenged in courts of law thereby delaying the implementation of these laws, the vary purpose of enacting these laws would be frustrated and the national economy may be severely affected. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necessary should have the constitutional protection are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule.</p><br> <p>5.

This was the position when the Constitution came into force. Subsequently, while the age of retirement of the High Court Judges was raised to 62, that of the Chairman and the Members of the State Public Service Commissions remained unchanged.</p><br> <p>The same article provides that one-half of the members of every Public Service Commission shall be employees of the Government of India or the Government of a State. The age of retirement of Government employees was 55 originally but was later raised to 58 in the case of All-India Services, Central Government servants and the Government servants of several States. Membership of the Commission is no attraction, therefore, to them, as they will have only two years to serve on the Commission which position is not desirable from the point of view of the efficient functioning of the Commission.</p><br> <p>Academicians like University Professors are eligible for appointment to the State Public Service Commissions. The age of retirement of University Professors has been recently raised to 60. It will not be attractive for these academicians to serve on a Public Service Commission if the age of retirement remains sixty.

Consequently, no eminent academician will be eager to accept appointment on the Commission unless the age of retirement is raised to 62.</p><br> <p>The proposal is to raise the age of retirement of the Chairman and Members of the State Public Service Commissions to 62.

If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the Constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy. The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some years now.</p><br> <p>2. The democratic institutions provided in the Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good.</p><br> <p>3. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities, whether by individuals or associations.</p><br> <p>4. Parliament and the State Legislatures embody the will of the people and the essence of democracy is that the will of the people should prevail. Even though article 368 of the Constitution is clear and categoric with regard to the all inclusive nature of the amending power, it is considered necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. It is proposed to strengthen the presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures by providing for a requirements as to the minimum number of Judges for determining questions as to the constitutionality of laws and for a special majority of not less than two-thirds for declaring any law to be constitutionally invalid. It is also proposed to take away the jurisdiction of High Courts with regard to determination of Constitutional validity of Central laws and confer exclusive jurisdiction in this behalf on the Supreme Court so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings with regard to validity of the same Central law in different High Courts and the consequent possibility of the Central law being valid in one State and invalid in another State.</p><br> <p>5. To reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other matters of special importance in the context of the socio-economic development and progress, it is considered expedient to provide for administrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while preserving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in regard to such matters under article 136 of the Constitution. It is also necessary to make certain modifications in the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under article 226.</p><br> <p>6. It is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to make certain other amendments which have become necessary in the light of the working of the Constitution.</p><br> <p>7. The various amendments proposed in the Bill have been explained in the notes on clauses.</p><br> <p>8. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; H. R.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1977 (Bill No. 148 of 1977) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-third Amendment) Act, 1977</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>The Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, inserted various articles in the Constitution to curtail, both directly and indirectly, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws. Article 32A barred the Supreme Court from considering the constitutional validity of any State law in proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights unless the constitutional validity of any Central law was also in issue in such proceedings. Article 131A gave to the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to decide the constitutional validity of a Central law and thus deprived the High Courts of their jurisdiction in respect of the same. Article 144A provided that the minimum number of Judges of the Supreme Court who shall sit for the purpose of determining the constitutional validity of any Central law or State law shall be seven and required a special majority of two-thirds for the invalidation of such law. Article 226A barred the High Courts from deciding the validity of any Central law and article 228A required that there should be a Bench of at least five Judges for determining the constitutional validity of any State law and prescribed a special majority for a judgment invalidating such a law.</p><br> <p>2. It is considered that articles 32A, 131A and 228A cause, hardship to persons living in distant parts in India. Further, article 32A would lead to multiplicity of proceedings as cases relating to the validity of a State law which could be disposed of by the Supreme Court itself have to be heard first by the High Court. The minimum number of Judges in every case wherein the constitutional validity of a law is involved, however unsubstantial the challenge might be, results in valuable judicial time being lost in hearing and rejecting submissions that have no substance. The Supreme Court has, in M/s. Misrilal Jain vs. the State of Orissa and Others (AIR 1977 SC 1686) expressed the hope that article 144A would engage the prompt attention of Parliament and would be amended so as to leave to the court itself the duty to decide how large a Bench should decide any particular case. In fact, a number of cases have been held up in the Supreme Court and High Courts as a result of the aforementioned articles.</p><br> <p>3. It is, therefore, proposed to omit articles 32A, 131A, 144A, 226A and 228A. It is also proposed to make special provisions to enable the Supreme Court and the High Courts to deal with pending cases in the same manner as if the said articles had been omitted with effect from the 1st February, 1977 (viz., the date on which those articles were brought into force). Necessary consequential amendments to articles 145, 228 and 366 are also proposed to be made.</p><br> <p>4. Article 31D confers special power on Parliament to enact certain laws in respect of anti-national activities.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1978 (Bill No. 88 of 1978) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>Recents experience has shown that the fundamental rights, including those of life and liberty, granted to citizens by the Constitution are capable of being taken away by a transient majority. It is, therefore, necessary to provide adequate safeguards against the recurrence of such a contingency in the future and to ensure to the people themselves an effective voice in determining the form of government under which they are to live. This is one of the primary objects of this Bill.</p><br> <p>2. It is, therefore, proposed to provide that certain changes in the Constitution which would have the effect of impairing its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage and compromising the independence of judiciary, can be made only if they are approved by the people of India by a majority of votes at a referendum in which at least fifty-one per cent. of the electorate participate. Article 368 is being amended to ensure this.</p><br> <p>3. In view of the special position sought to be given to fundamental rights, the right to property, which has been the occasion for more than one amendment of the Constitution, would cease to be a fundamental right and become only a legal right. Necessary amendments for this purpose are being made to article 19 and article 31 is being deleted. It would, however, be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental rights would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.</p><br> <p>4. Similarly, the right of persons holding land for personal cultivation and within the ceiling limit to receive compensation at the market value would not be affected.</p><br> <p>5. Property, while ceasing to be a fundamental right, would, however, be given express recognition as a legal right, provision being made that no person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law.</p><br> <p>6. A Proclamation of Emergency under article 352 has virtually the effect of amending the Constitution by converting it for the duration into that of a Unitary State and enabling the rights of the citizen to move the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights---including the right to life and liberty---to be suspended. Adequate safeguards are, therefore, necessary to ensure that this power is properly exercised and is not abused. It is, therefore, proposed that a Proclamation of Emergency can be issued only when the security of India or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion. Internal disturbance not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for the issue of a Proclamation.</p><br> <p>7. Further, in order to ensure that a Proclamation is issued only after due consideration, it is sought to be provided that an Emergency can be proclaimed only on the basis of written advice tendered to the President by the Cabinet. In addition, as a Proclamation of Emergency virtually has the effect of amending the Constitution, it is being provided that the Proclamation would have to be approved by the two Houses of Parliament by the same majority which is necessary to amend the Constitution and such approval would have to be given within a period of one month. Any such Proclamation would be in force only for a period of six months and can be continued only by further resolutions passed by the same majority. The Proclamation would also cease to be in operation if a resolution disapproving the continuance of the Proclamation is passed by Lok Sabha. Ten per cent. or more of the Members of Lok Sabha can requisition a special meeting for considering a resolution for disapproving the Proclamation.</p><br> <p>8. As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court.</p><br> <p>9. A special provision is being made guaranteeing the right of the media to report freely and without censorship the proceedings in Parliament and the State Legislatures. The provision with regard to the breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the States is being amended so as to provide that a Proclamation issued under article 356 would be in force only for a period of six months in the first instance and that it cannot exceed one year ordinarily. However, if a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation and the Election Commission certifies that the extension of the President\'s rule beyond a period of one year is necessary on account of difficulties in holding elections to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, the period of operation of the Proclamation can be extended beyond one year. This is subject to the existing limit of three years. These changes would ensure that democratic rule is restored to a State after the minimum period which will be necessary for holding elections.</p><br> <p>10. With a view to avoiding delays, it is proposed to amend articles 132, 133 and 134 and insert a new article 134A to provide that a High Court should consider the question of granting a certificate for appeal to Supreme Court immediately after the delivery of the judgment, decree, final order or sentence concerned on the basis of an oral application by a party or, if the High Court deems fit so to do, on its own motion. Cases of special leave to appeal by Supreme Court will be left to be regulated exclusively by article 136.</p><br> <p>11. The other amendments proposed in the Bill are mainly for removing or correcting the distortions which came into the Constitution by reason of amendments enacted during the period of the Internal Emergency.</p><br> <p>12. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. The notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions of the Bill.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; SHANTI BHUSHAN.</p><br> <p>The 9th May, 1978.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY-FOURTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1978</p><br> <p>-----------</p><br> <p>ARRANGEMENT OF SECTIONS</p><br> <p>-------------</p><br> <p>SECTIONS</p><br> <p>1.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>Sales tax laws enacted in pursuance of the Government of India Act, 1935 as also the laws relating to sales tax passed after the coming into force of the Constitution proceeded on the footing that the expression \"sale of goods\", having regard to the rule as to broad interpretation of entries in the legislative lists, would be given a wider connotation. However, in Gannon Dunkerley\'s case (A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560), the Supreme Court held that the expression \"sale of goods\" as used in the entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. This decision related to works contracts.</p><br> <p>2. By a series of subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court has, on the basis of the decision in Gannon Dunkerley\'s case, held various other transactions which resemble, in substance, transactions by way of sales, to be not liable to sales tax. As a result of these decisions, a transaction, in order to be subject to the levy of sales tax under entry 92A of the Union List or entry 54 of the State List, should have the following ingredients, namely, parties competent to contract, mutual assent and transfer of property in goods from one of the parties to the contract to the other party thereto for a price.</p><br> <p>3. This position has resulted in scope for avoidance of tax in various ways. An example of this is the practice of inter-State consignment transfers, i.e., transfer of goods from head office or a principal in one State to a branch or agent in another State or vice versa or transfer of goods on consignment account, to avoid the payment of sales tax on inter-State sales under the Central Sales Tax Act. While in the case of a works contract, if the contract treats the sale of materials separately from the cost of the labour, the sale of materials would be taxable, but in the case of an indivisible works contract, it is not possible to levy sales tax on the transfer of property in the goods involved in the execution of such contract as it has been held that there is no sale of the materials as such and the property in them does not pass as moveables. Though practically the purchaser in a hire-purchase agreement gets the goods on the date of the hire-purchase, it has been held that there is sale only when the purchaser exercises the option to purchase at a much later date and therefore only the depreciated value of the goods involved in such transaction at the time the option to purchase is exercised becomes assessable to sales tax. Similarly, while sale by a registered club or other association of persons (the club or association of persons having corporate status) to its members is taxable, sales by an unincorporated club or association of persons to its members is not taxable as such club or association, in law, has no separate existence from that of the members. In the Associated Hotels of India case (A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1131), the Supreme Court held that there is no sale involved in the supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel.</p><br> <p>4. In the New India Sugar Mills case (A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207), the Supreme Court took the view that in the transfer of controlled commodities in pursuance of a direction under a Control Order, the element of volition by the seller, or mutual assent, is absent and, therefore, there is no sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. However, in Oil and Natural Gas Commission Vs. State of Bihar (A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2478), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider its earlier decisions with regard to the liability of transfers of controlled commodities to be charged to sales tax. The Supreme Court held that where there are any statutory compulsions, the statute itself should be treated as supplying the consensus and furnishing the modality of the consensus. In Vishnu Agencies Vs. Commercial Tax Officer (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 449), six of the seven Judges concurred in over-ruling the decision, in New India Sugar Mills case while the seventh Judge held the case to be distinguishable. It is, therefore, considered desirable to put the matter beyond any doubt.</p><br> <p>5. The various problems connected with the power of the States to levy a tax on the sale of goods and with the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 were referred to the Law Commission of India. The Commission considered these matters in their Sixty-first Report and, recommended, inter alia, certain amendments in the Constitution if as a matter of administrative policy it is decided to levy tax on transactions of the nature mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.</p><br> <p>6. Device by way of lease of films has also been resulting in avoidance of sales tax. The main right in regard to a film relates to its exploitation and after exploitation for a certain period of time, in most cases, the film ceases to have any value. It is, therefore, seen that instead of resorting to the outright sale of a film, only a leased or transfer of the right to exploitation is made.</p><br> <p>7. There were reports from State Governments to whom revenues from sales tax have been assigned, as to the large scale avoidance of Central sales tax leviable on inter-State sales of goods through the device of consignment of goods from one State to another and as to the leakage of local sales tax in works contracts, hire-purchase transactions, lease of films, etc. Though Parliament could levy a tax on these transactions, as tax on sales has all along been treated as an item of revenue to be assigned to the States, in regard to these transactions which resemble sales also, it is considered that the same policy should be adopted.</p><br> <p>8. Besides the above mentioned matters, a new problem has arisen as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. Vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 1591). States have been proceeding on the basis that the Associated Hotels of India case was applicable only to supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel and that tax was leviable on the sale of foodstuffs by a restaurant. But over-ruling the decision of the Delhi High Court, the Supreme Court has held in the above case that service of meals whether in a hotel or restaurant does not constitute a sale of food for the purpose of levy of sales tax but must be regarded as the rendering of a service in the satisfaction of a human need or ministering to the bodily want of human beings. It would not make any difference whether the visitor to the restaurant is charged for the meal as a whole or according to each dish separately.</p><br> <p>9. It is, therefore, proposed to suitably amend the Constitution to include in article 366 a definition of \"tax on the sale or purchase of goods\" by inserting a new clause (29A). The definition would specifically include within the scope of that expression tax on---</p><br> <p>(i) transfer for consideration of controlled commodities;</p><br> <p>(ii) the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract;</p><br> <p>(iii) delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments;</p><br> <p>(iv) transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;</p><br> <p>(v) the supply of goods by an unincorporated association or body of persons to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;</p><br> <p>vi) the supply, by way of or as part of any service, of food or any drink for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration. (See clause 4).</p><br> <p>10. A new entry is sought to be inserted in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule, as entry 92B, to enable the levy of tax on the consignment of goods where such consignment takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. (See clause 5).</p><br> <p>11. Clause (1) of article 269 is proposed to be amended so that the tax levied on the consignment of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce shall be assigned to the States. Clause (3) of that article is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to formulate by law principles for determining when a consignment of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. (See clause 2).</p><br> <p>12. Clause (3) of article 286 is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to specify, by law, restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the transfer of goods involved in the execution of a works contract, on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments and on the right to use any goods. (See clause 3).</p><br> <p>13. The proposed amendments would help in the augmentation of the State revenues to a considerable extent. Cluase 6 of the Bill seeks to validate laws levying tax on the supply of food or drink for consideration and also the collection or recoveries made by way of tax under any such law. However, no sales tax will be payable on food or drink supplied by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel during the period from the date of the judgment in the Associated Hotels of India case and the commencement of the present Amendment Act if the conditions mentioned in sub-clause (2) of clause 6 of the Bill are satisfied. In the case of food or drink supplied by Restaurants this relief will be available only in respect of the period after the date of judgment in the Northern India Caterers (India) Limited case and the commencement of the present Amendment Act.</p><br> <p>14.

The State Governments of Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and the Administration of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule. Some of the Acts suggested for inclusion are by way of amendments to Acts already included in the Ninth Schedule.

The Bill also makes suitable provisions with respect to splits in, and mergers of, political parties. A special provision has been included in the Bill to enable a person who has been elected as the presiding officer of a House to sever his connections with his political party.

Even though these States are predominantly tribal areas, the underlying objective of the aforesaid Act was to ensure that the members of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas do not fair to secure a minimal representation because of their inability to complete with the advanced sections of the people.</p><br> <p>2. The Constitution (Fifty-first Amendment) Act, though formally enforced, cannot be fully implemented unless parallel action is taken to determine the seats which are to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes in these areas. The number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of any State under article 332 of the Constitution will have to be determined having regard to the provisions of article 332(3) of the Constitution. However, in view of the historical background with respect to the areas comprised in the North-Eastern States, the circumstances obtaining in these areas in the state of development of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas and other relevant considerations, it is considered necessary to provide for special arrangements with regard to the reservation for Scheduled Tribes in these areas for a temporary period so as to facilitate easy transition of these areas to the normal arrangements as envisaged in the Constitution. It is, therefore, proposed to further amend article 332 of the Constitution for making a temporary provision, until the re-adjustment of seats on the basis of the first census after the year 2000 under article 170 of the Constitution for these States, for the determination of the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes.</p><br> <p>3. The proposed amendment seeks to provide that if all the seats in the Legislative Assembly of such States in existence on the date of coming into force of this Constitution Amendment Act are held by the members of the Scheduled Tribes, all the seats except one shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes and in any other case such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats a proportion not less than the number of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total number of seats in the existing Assembly.</p><br> <p>4.

Any Hindi version of the Constitution should not only conform to the Hindi translation published by the Constituent Assembly, but should also be in conformity with the language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of Central Acts in Hindi. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution so as to empower the President of India to publish under his authority the translation of the Constitution in Hindi signed by the members of the Constituent Assembly with such modifications as may be necessary to bring it in conformity with the language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of Central Acts in the Hindi language. The President would also be authorised to publish the translation in Hindi of every amendment of the Constitution made in English.</p><br> <p>3.

The one-year period in the case of the Proclamation made with respect to the State of Punjab is due to expire on the 10th May, 1988. In view of the continued disturbed situation in Punjab, escalation in the activities of terrorists and anti-national forces resulting in the death of innocent men, women and children and of the fact that the Punjab State Legislative Assembly had to be dissolved because of the virtual impossibility of forming a popular Government in the prevailing circumstances, the continuance in force of the said Proclamation beyond the period of one year may be necessary in Punjab. Article 356(5) of the Constitution is, therefore, proposed to be amended so as to facilitate the extension of the said Proclamation, if necessary up to a period of three years as permissible under clause (4) of that article.</p><br> <p>The continuance of the Proclamation after the 10th May, 1988 may not, it is felt, be effective as terrorist activities had been on the increase. It may be necessary to invoke the provisions of article 352 of the Constitution to declare a partial Emergence either in the whole of the State of Punjab or in particular districts of that State. If such a situation arises, the expression \"armed rebellion\" included in that article as one of the grounds for declaration of Emergency (which alone could be resorted to in the case of an Internal Emergency) may not be appropriate in the prevailing situation in Punjab to declare a Proclamation in that State. It is, therefor, felt that article 352 may be suitably amended in its application to the State of Punjab to include \"internal disturbance\" as one of the grounds that the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in any part of the territory of India so as to facilitate the taking of action under that article if it becomes necessary at a future date. The expression \"internal disturbance\" was one of the grounds included in that article from the commencement of the Constitution till it was amended by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978. Consequentially, articles 358 and 359 are also proposed to be amended so as to provide for the automatic suspension of article 19 of the Constitution and the issuing of an order by the President suspending the operation of any of the other provisions contained in Part III (except article 20) under article 359, if and when a Proclamation of Emergency on the ground of internal disturbance is issued in relation to the whole or any part of the State of Punjab.</p><br> <p>As the proposed amendments are only for the purpose of curbing the terrorist activities in the State of Punjab more effectively, the powers that are proposed to be conferred by these amendments would not be resorted to for any period beyond what is absolutely necessary for achieving the aforesaid object. Accordingly, the amendments proposed in articles 352, 358 and 359 have been made to be operative only for a period of two years from the commencement of this Amendment.</p><br> <p>The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; BUTA SINGH.</p><br> <p>The 11th March, 1988.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (FIFTY-NINTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1988</p><br> <p>[30th March, 1988.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-ninth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

The proviso to that clause, however, enables the continuance of the levy of such tax at a rate exceeding two hundred and fifty rupees per annum in any State, municipality, etc., if in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of Constitution there was in force in that State, municipality, etc., any such tax exceeding that rate.</p><br> <p>2. Some of the State Governments have represented that this selling of two hundred and fifty rupees which was fixed in 1949, needs to be revised upwards taking into consideration the price rise and other factors. It is also pointed out that the profession tax has, at present, become almost regressive because of the ceiling since even people with high salaries have to pay this tax at only the maximum amount of two hundred and fifty rupees per annum. The upward revision of profession tax will also help the State Governments in raising additional resources.</p><br> <p>3. It is accordingly proposed to amend clause (2) of article 276 of the Constitution to increase the ceiling of profession tax from two hundred and fifty rupees per annum to two thousand and five hundred rupees per annum.

In our country some of the State Governments have adopted 18 years of age for elections to the local authorities. The present-day youth are literate and enlightened and the lowering of the voting age would provide to the unrepresented youth of the country an opportunity to give vent to their feelings and help them become a part of the political process.

The Government of India appointed on 24-12-1987 a Committee to go into the various issues connected with the administration of Delhi and to recommend measures inter alia for the streamlining of the administrative set-up. The Committee went into the matter in great detail and considered the issues after holding discussions with various individuals, associations, political parties and other experts and taking into account the arrangements in the national Capitals of other countries with a federal set-up and also the debates in the Constituent Assembly as also the reports by earlier Committees and Commissions. After such detailed inquiry and examination, it recommended that Delhi should continue to be a Union territory and provided with a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible to such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with matters of concern to the common man.

At present article 54 relating to the election of the President provides for an electoral college consisting of only the elected Members of Parliament as well as the Legislative Assemblies of the States (not Union territories). Similarly, article 55 providing for the manner of such election also speaks of Legislative Assemblies of States. Accordingly, an Explanation is sought to be inserted in article 54 to provide that reference to \"State\" in articles 54 and 55 would include the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of Pondicherry for constituting the electoral college for election of the President. This would enable the elected members of the Legislative Assembly created for the Union territory of Pondicherry under the provisions of article 239A and of the proposed Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi under article 239AA to be included in the electoral college.</p><br> <p>2. THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1991 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 received assent of the President on 21st December, 1991. The said Bill as originally introduced in the Lok Sabha sought to incorporate in article 239AA a sub-clause (b) to clause (7). This proposed sub-clause was subsequently dropped since inclusion of the said sub-clause would have necessitated ratification of the Bill by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States and thereby delayed the early constitution of a Legislative Assembly for the Union territory of Delhi. The said sub-clause (clause 3 of the present Bill) is sought to be inserted in the present Constitution (Amendment) Bill with retrospective effect i.e. from 21st December, 1991. Ratification by States is also proposed to be obtained for the clause along with ratification for the other clause of the Bill which seeks to amend article 54.</p><br> <p>3.

The said Memorandum provides for a greater share of tribals in the governance of the State. The said Memorandum envisages amendment of the Constitution to provide that notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution, the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tripura reserved for Scheduled Tribes shall be, such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats, a proportion not less than the number, as on the date of coming into force of the Constitutional amendment, of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total number of seats in the existing Assembly.

In order to implement the said Memorandum, action is to be taken to determine the seats which are to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the State of Tripura. Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of any State is governed by the provisions of article 332 of the Constitution. Having regard to the special circumstances obtaining in the State of Tripura, it is proposed to further amend article 332 of the Constitution for making a temporary provision for the determination of the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes until the re-adjustment of seats on the basis of the first census after the year 2000 under article 170 of the Constitution for the State of Tripura.</p><br> <p>3.

Article 40 of the Constitution which enshrines one of the Directive Principles of State Policy lays down that the State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. In the light of the experience in the last forty years and in view of the short-comings which have been observed, it is considered that there is an imperative need to enshrine in the Constitution certain basic and essential features of Panchayati Raj Institutions to impart certainty, continuity and strength to them.</p><br> <p>3. Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new Part relating to Panchayats in the Constitution to provide for among other things, Gram Sabha in a village or group of villages; constitution of Panchayats at village and other level or levels; direct elections to all seats in Panchayats at the village and intermediate level, if any, and to the offices of Chairpersons of Panchayats at such levels; reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for membership of Panchayats and office of Chairpersons in Panchayats at each level; reservation of not less than one-third of the seats for women; fixing tenure of 5 years for Panchayats and holding elections within a period of 6 months in the event of supersession of any Panchayat; disqualifications for membership of Panchayats; devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Panchayats with respect to the preparation of plans for economic developments and social justice and for the implementation of development schemes; sound finance of the Panchayats by securing authorisation from State Legislatures for grants-in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State, as also assignment to, or appropriation by, the Panchayats of the revenues of designated taxes, duties, tolls and fees; setting up of a Finance Commission within one year of the proposed amendment and thereafter every 5 years to review the financial position of Panchayats; auditing of accounts of the Panchayats; powers of State Legislatures to make provisions with respect to elections to Panchayats under the superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State; application of the provisions of the said Part to Union territories; excluding certain States and areas from the application of the provisions of the said Part; continuance of existing laws and Panchayats until one year from the commencement of the proposed amendment and barring interference by courts in electoral matters relating to Panchayats.</p><br> <p>4.

Some of the deleterious legal consequences include mounting and unending litigation, inability of the courts to provide timely justice, evolution of practices and systems to by pass the operations of rent legislations and steady shrinkage of rental housing market.</p><br> <p>2. The Supreme Court, taking note of the precarious state of rent litigation in the country, in the case of Prabhakaran Nair and others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (Civil Writ Petition 506 of 1986 and other writs) observed that the Supreme Court and the High Courts should be relieved of the heavy burden of rent litigation. Tiers of appeals should be curtailed. Laws should be simple, rational and clear. Litigations must come to end quickly. The idea of a National Rent Tribunal on an all-India basis with quicker procedure should be examined.</p><br> <p>3. It is proposed to amend article 323B in Part XIVA of the Constitution so as to give timely relief to the rent litigants by providing for setting up of State-level Rent Tribunals in order to reduce the tiers of appeals and to exclude the jurisdiction of all courts, except that of the Supreme Court, under article 136 of the Constitution.</p><br> <p>4.

			"content": "<p>Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1994 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy-sixth Amendment) Act, 1994</p><br> <p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS</p><br> <p>The policy of reservation of seats in Educational Institutions and reservation of appointments of posts in public services for Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has had a long history in Tamil Nadu dating back to the year 1921. The extent of reservation has been increased by the State Government from time to time, consistent with the needs of the majority of the people and it has now reached the level of 69 per cent. (18 per cent. Scheduled Castes, 1 per cent. Scheduled Tribes and 50 per cent. Other Backward Classes).</p><br> <p>2. The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Indira Sawhney and others Vs. Union of India and Others (AIR 1993 SC 477) on 16th November, 1992, holding that the total reservations under article 16(4) should not exceed 50 per cent.</p><br> <p>3. The issue of admission to educational institutions for the academic year 1993-94 came up before the High Court of Madras in a writ petition. The High Court of Madras held that the Tamil Nadu Government could continue its reservation policy as hitherto followed during that academic year and that the quantum of reservation should be brought down to 50 per cent. during the academic year 1994-95. The Government of Tamil Nadu had filed a Special Leave Petition against the High Court of Madras in order that the present reservation policy of the State Government should be reaffirmed so as to ensure to continue advancement of the Backward Classes. However, the Supreme Court of India passed an interim order reiterating that the reservation should not exceed 50 per cent. in the matter of admission to educational institutions.</p><br> <p>4. In the special Session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly held on 9th November, 1993, it had been unanimously resolved to call upon the Central Government to take steps immediately to bring a suitable amendment to the Constitution of India as to enable the Government of Tamil Nadu to continue its policy of 69 per cent. reservation in Government Services and for admission in Educational Institutions as at present. An all parties meeting had also been held on 26th November, 1993 in Tamil Nadu urging that there should not be any doubt or delay in ensuring the continued implementation of 69 per cent. reservation for the welfare and advancement of the backward classes.</p><br> <p>5. The Tamil Nadu Government enacted a legislation namely Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Bill, 1993 and forwarded it to the Government of India for consideration of the President of India in terms of article 31-C of the Constitution.</p><br> <p>6. In view of the importance and sensitive nature of the matter, the Union Home Minister held meetings with the leaders of Political Parties on 13th July, 1994 to discuss the provisions of the Bill. The general consensus among the leaders was that the Bill should be assented to. Accordingly, the President gave his assent to the Bill on 19th July, 1994.</p><br> <p>7. The Tamil Nadu Government accordingly notified the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of appointment or posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993 as Act No. 45 of 1994 on 19th July, 1994.</p><br> <p>8. The Tamil Nadu Government requested the Government of India on 22nd July, 1994 that the aforementioned Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994 be included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution of India for the reasons given below:-</p><br> <p>\"The said Act attracts article 31C of the Constitution, as falling within the purview of clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and articles 38 and 46 of the Constitution-vide section 2 of the Act. The Act has been passed relying on the directive principles of State Policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution and in particular, articles 38, 39 (b) and (c) and 46 of the Constitution. As the Act is to give effect to the directive principles of State Policy contained, inter alia, in article 39(b) and (c), the said Act will get the protection of article 31C of the Constitution and therefore, cannot be challenged under articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution, with reference to which article 14, the reservation exceeding 50 per cent. has been struck down by the Supreme Court. Now it has been decided to address the Government of India for including the Act in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, so that the law cannot be challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution including articles 15 and 16, and gets protection under article 31B of the Constitution.\"</p><br> <p>9. The Government of India has already supported the provision of the State legislation by giving the President\\'s assent to the Tamil Nadu Bill. As a corollary to this decision, it is now necessary that the Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994 is brought within the purview of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution so that it gets protection under article 31B of the Constitution in regard to the judicial review.</p><br> <p>10. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforementioned objective.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI; SITARAM KESRI.</p><br> <p>The 23rd August, 1994.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTY-SIXTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1994</p><br> <p>[31st August, 1994.]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Forty-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

This ruling of the Supreme Court will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the States have not reached the required level, it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interest of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. To carry out this, it is necessary to amend article 16 of the Constitution by inserting a new clause (4A) in the said article to provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.</p><br> <p>2.

The said report was laid on the table of both the Houses of Parliament on the 14th March,1995. One of the recommendations of the Commission that has been under consideration of the Government is an alternative scheme of sharing of the proceeds of certain Union taxes and duties between the Union and the States.</p><br> <p>2. The alternative scheme envisages that twenty-six per cent out of the gross proceeds of Union taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax,Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purposes under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assigned to the States in lieu of their existing share in income-tax, basic excise duties, special excise duties and grants in lieu of tax on railway passenger fares.</p><br> <p>3. In addition, three per cent share in the gross proceeds of all Central taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal/toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax, Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purpose under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assigned to the States in lieu of their existing share in Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on tobacco, cotton and sugar. The commission had proposed that tobacco, cotton and sugar may continue to be exempt from Sales Tax and the Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on these items may be merged with the Basic Excise Duties.</p><br> <p>4. Whether the alternative scheme would be more gainful to the Centre or to the States vis--vis existing arrangements would entirely depend on the relative growth in the Collection of various Central taxes and duties to be pooled.</p><br> <p>5. The benefits of the scheme have been listed by the Commission in para 13.2. and 13.3 and 13.18 of their reports. These areas follows:-</p><br> <p>(i) with a given share being allotted to the States in the aggregate revenues from Central taxes, the States will be able to share the aggregate buoyancy of Central taxes;</p><br> <p>(ii) the Central Government can pursue tax reforms without the need to consider whether a tax is sharable in the states or not;</p><br> <p>(iii) the impact of fluctuations in Central tax revenues would be felt alike by the Central and the State Governments;</p><br> <p>(iv) Should the taxes mentioned in articles 268 and/or 269 from part of this arrangement, there will be greater likelihood of their being tapped; and</p><br> <p>(v) the progress of reforms will be greatly facilitated if the ambit of tax sharing arrangement is enlarged so as to give greater certainty of resource flows to, and increased flexibility in tax reform.</p><br> <p>6. The above scheme recommended by the Commission is in national interest as it helps to remove a perceived inter-tax in the tax mobilisation effort of the Government of India while leaving sufficient flexibility for meeting Centres exclusive needs by keeping Cesses and Surcharges outside the pooling arrangement.</p><br> <p>7. A Discussion Paper bringing out various aspects of the scheme was laid on the table of both the Houses of Parliament on the 20th December, 1996 with a view to generate an informed debate.</p><br> <p>8. On the basis of a consensus reached in the Third Meeting of the inter-State Council held on the 17th July, 1997, the then Government had agreed in principle to accept the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission subject to certain modifications.</p><br> <p>9. The Government had decided to ratify the decision taken by the previous Government according in principle approval for the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission with some modifications.</p><br> <p>10. Firstly, the percentage share of State is to be reviewed by the successive Finance Commissions instead of freezing it for fifteen years as suggested by the Tenth Finance Commission.</p><br> <p>11. Secondly, Government had decided to change the sharing of gross proceeds as recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission to the sharing of net proceeds in order to maintain consistency between articles 270, 279 and 280 of the Constitution. However, this will not result in any consequent loss to the States because the Government has also simultaneously decided to compensate the States by suitably enhancing the percentage share beyond 29%.</p><br> <p>12. Thirdly, as intended by the Commission, no amendment is sought to be done in article 271, which authorize the Central Government to levy surcharge on Central taxes and duties for the purpose of the Union.</p><br> <p>13. The scheme will be effective from 1st April, 1996. The percentage share of net proceeds during 1996-97 to 1999-2000 will be such that the States share is 29% of the gross proceeds. The recommendations of the 11th Finance Commission, which has been mandated to give its final report by 30th June, 2000, will cover the 5 years period w.e.f. 1st April, 2000.</p><br> <p>14. In order to implement this decision, this Bill seeks to amend article 269, 270 and 272 of the Constitution so as to bring several Central taxes and duties like Corporation tax and Customs duties at par with personal income-tax as far as their constitutionally mandated sharing with the States is concerned.</p><br> <p>NEW DELHI YASHWANT SINHA</p><br> <p>The 25th February, 2000.</p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (EIGHTIETH AMENDMENT) ACT, 2000</p><br> <p>[9th June, 2000]</p><br> <p>An Act further to amend the Constitution of India.</p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-First Year of the Republic of India as follows:-</p><br> <p>1.

These vacancies were treated as a distinct group and were excluded from the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation. The Supreme Court of India in its judgment in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a year including carried forward reservations should in no case exceed the limit of fifty per cent. As total reservations in a year for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the other Backward Classes combined together had already reached forty-nine and a half per cent and the total number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could not exceed fifty per cent., it became difficult to fill the \"Backlog Vacancies\" and to hold Special Recruitment Drives. Therefore, to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court, an Official Memorandum dated August 29, 1997 was issued to provide that the fifty per cent limit shall apply to current as well as \"Backlog Vacancies\" and for discontinuation of the Special Recruitment Drive.</p><br> <p>2. Due to the adverse effect of the aforesaid order dated August 29, 1997, various organisations including the Members of Parliament represented to the central Government for protecting the interest of the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The Government, after considering various representations, reviewed the position and has decided to make amendment in the constitution so that the unfilled vacancies of a year, which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) of article 16 of the Constitution, shall be considered as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent.

These provisos were inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 as a measure to boost family planning norms. Since the first census to be taken after the year 2000 has already begun, the constitutional embargo on undertaking fresh delimitation will lapse as soon as the figures of this census are published.</p><br> <p>2. There have been consistent demands, both for and against undertaking the exercise of fresh delimitation. Keeping in view the progress of family planning programmes in different parts of the country, the Government, as part of the National Population Policy strategy, recently decided to extend the current freeze on undertaking fresh delimitation up to the year 2026 as a motivational measure to enable the State Government to pursue the agenda for population stabilisation.</p><br> <p>3. Government has also decided to undertake readjustment and rationalization of territorial constituencies in the States, without altering the number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States, including the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes constituencies, on the basis of the population ascertained at the census for the year 1991, so as to remove the imbalance caused due to uneven growth of population/electorate in different constituencies.</p><br> <p>4. It is also proposed to refix the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of the States on the basis of the population ascertained at the census for the year 1991.</p><br> <p><strong>ARUN JAITLEY</strong></p><br> <p>New Delhi;</p><br> <p>The 8th November, 2000</p><br> <p><strong>Bill No. 172-F of 2000</strong></p><br> <p>THE CONSTITUTION (EIGHTY-FOURTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 2002</p><br> <p><i>[21st February 2002]</i></p><br> <p>BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-second Year of the Republic of India as follows:</p><br> <table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td> 	1.

The Tenth Schedule has also been criticised on the ground that it allowsbulk defections while declaring individual defections as illegal. The provisions for exemptionfrom disqualification in case of splits as provided in paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to theConstitution of India has, in particular, come under severe criticism on account of itsdestablilising effect on the Government.<br><br>2. The Committee on Electoral Reforms (Dinesh Goswami Committee) in its report ofMay, 1990, the Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on “Reform of Electoral Laws”(1999) and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) inits report of March 31, 2002 have, inter alia, recommended omission of said paragraph 3 of theTenth Schedule to the Constitution of India pertaining to exemption from disqualification incase of splits. The NCRWC is also of the view that a defector should be penalised for his actionby debarring him from holding any public office as a Minister or any other remunerativepolitical post for at least the duration of the remaining term of the existing Legislature or until,the next fresh elections whichever is earlier. It is proposed to accept these suggestions.<br><br>3. The NCRWC has also observed that abnormally large Councils of Ministers werebeing constituted by various Governments at Centre and States and this practice had to beprohibited by law and that a ceiling on the number of Ministers in a State or the UnionGovernment be fixed at the maximum of 10% of the total strength of the popular House of theLegislature.<br><br>4. In the light of the above, it is proposed to amend the Constitution by omittingparagraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India and to provide that the size of theCouncil of Ministers should not be more than 10% of the strength of House or Housesconcerned whether Unicameral or Bicameral. However, in case of smaller States like Sikkim,Mizoram and Goa having 32, 40 and 40 Members in the Legislative Assemblies respectively, aminimum strength of seven Ministers is proposed.<br><br>5.
